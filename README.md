# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members
*Patrick Ayers
*Zackary Larson

## Analysis Objective
Compare contrast between weather patterns on Earth & Mars. Where should one spend their summer holiday? Earth--where it can be snowy or sunny depending on the hemisphere; or Mars where it's mostly barren, laking an atmosphere, and resembles deserts in Arizona.

This project will use the Inight dataset provided by NASA which features API connectivity along with a flat file of Earth weather data, where both sets will be compared, cotrasted, and help you decide whether that summer hike on Olympus Mons is worth it.

### Feature Summary:
*Selct a major city from a list along with a season and compare weather data to the weather on Mars during the same season
*Using NASA API to bring in data, and show some creat graphs
*Earth data brought in from flat file

## Dataypes that will be utilized
*Dataset 1 -> Mars Insight Weather API
*https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/
* 
*Dataset 2 -> Earth Weather flat file (PENDING: Decide on exact data set)
*https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api

## Protenal packages we will explore
*dotenv module - for storing API keys, and other personal information in a hidden\\
.env file.

*Request module - For pulling data from NASA website.

*Datetime module for managing dates and times 

*Marstiming - an open source library for calculating Mars time:
